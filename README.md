# Green-Destination-Data-Analysis
This repository contains code and resources for conducting analysis on employee attrition dataset. The purpose of this project is to explore, analyse, and derive insights from dataset to find out cause of high attrition rate. The analysis encompasses various aspects &amp; factors influencing various events.

## Project Overview

**I completed this analysis as part of my 1 month internship at Unified Mentor. I was asked to analyze the employee attrition data &amp; come up with meaningful insights.**

###  Data Sources

The primary dataset used for this analysis is in "greendestination-dataset.csv" file, containing detailed information about employees.

### Tools

- Python: Data Processing, Data Cleaning, Data Analysis
- Pandas: Data Cleaning, Data Analysis
- Microsoft Excel: Data Cleaning, Data Analysis
- Tableau: Data Visualization

## Approach for Data Analysis
1. **Ask**: ask questions & define problem
2. **Prepare**: prepare data by collecting & storing information
3. **Process**: process data by cleaning & checking information
4. **Analyse**: analyse data to find patterns & trends
5. **Share**: share data with audience
6. **Act**: act on data & use analysis results

### ASk
- What specific data has been collected for analysis? Are there any limitations or gaps in the data that might affect the analysis?
- How are years at the company calculated? Is it based on tenure or hire date?
- Have reasons for leaving been recorded for each departing employee? If so, what categories do these reasons fall into e.g. better job opportunity, dissatisfaction with management, relocation?

KPI's

- No. of employee's
- No. of attrition's
- Attrition rate
- Average Age
- Average Salary
- Average years employee worked in company

### PREPARE
- We received our dataset from unified mentor management team

### PROCESS
- Renamed the columns
- Checked for null values from all the columns of the dataset
- We found out most of the dataset was well organized

### ANALYSE
- Sorting & filtering data
- Calculated average salary, age, attrition rate & years employee work in a company
- Segregated Male & Female within the dataset
- Calculated attrition by job role
- Calculated attrition by age
- Calculated attrition by salary
- Calculated attrition by education

### ACT
